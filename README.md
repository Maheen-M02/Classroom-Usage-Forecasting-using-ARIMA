# 🧠 Classroom Usage Forecasting Project
The Classroom Usage Forecasting Project is designed to forecast next-hour electricity draw and its confidence intervals in the context of classroom usage. This project utilizes a Jupyter Notebook file, `Classroom_Usage_Forecasting.ipynb`, to load, preprocess, and analyze the "household_power_consumption.csv" dataset. The primary goal is to prepare this data for training an ARIMA model to forecast electricity draw.

## 🚀 Key Features
- Loads and preprocesses the "household_power_consumption.csv" dataset
- Trains an ARIMA model on the preprocessed data to forecast next-hour electricity draw
- Calculates confidence intervals for the forecast
- Integrates with Google Drive for accessing the dataset file
- Utilizes the Google Colab environment for interactive development and execution

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy` for numerical computations
- `matplotlib` and/or `seaborn` for data visualization
- `statsmodels` for the ARIMA model implementation
- Google Colab environment for execution and development
- Google Drive for storing and accessing the dataset file

## 📦 Getting Started / Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Install the required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `statsmodels`
- Set up a Google Colab environment
- Store the "household_power_consumption.csv" dataset in Google Drive

### Installation
- Install the required libraries using pip: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels`
- Mount the Google Drive account in the Google Colab environment

### Running locally
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Install the required libraries
- Run the `Classroom_Usage_Forecasting.ipynb` notebook in a local Jupyter environment
